My Gyroscope Sensor Application - Abdullah Jandali

## Goal
The goal of this Android application is to simulate an application that rejects or accepts phone calls. By turning the phone left or right, the gyroscope sensor determines whether the call in answered or declined, visualized through a color-changing background.

## Application/Scenario
This app is used mostly by car commuters or people who are too busy to answer the incoming calls. If someone is driving and has to keep their hands on the wheel, answering hands-free would benefit commuters greatly if they receive an important incoming call. Additionally, although just a little less important, if someone is too lazy to get up and reject a call, they could call out for their phone to reject it. 

When the user uses the app, they can see the z-value generated by the gyroscope sensor. When they turn the phone clockwise, the screen will turn green to simulate answering the phone call. When turned counter-clockwise, the screen turns red to simulate rejecting or ending the call.
