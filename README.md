# MyGyroscopeSensorApplication
My Accelerometer Sensor Application - Abdullah Jandali

## Goal
The goal of this Android application is to display the x, y, and z values to the user using a text view for each one of them; display the x, y, and z values in real time using MPAndroidChart Library; and it includes the hand motion detection for left to right hand motion (message that will be displayed: "You have answered the call.") or right to left hand motion (message that will be displayed: "You have rejected the call."). 

## Application/Scenario
When the user uses the app, it can see the x, y, and z values since they are displayed to the user. The user can also see the x, y, and z values being plotted in real time using MPAndroidChart Library. Also, the user can see a message "You have answered the call." when it moves its hand from left to right. Also, the user can see a message "You have rejected the call." when it moves its hand from right to left.
